# Assembling the Battery Case

You should be given a battery case and 10 battery tabs, 5 spring and 5 button. Below is a photo of a tab:

Notice it has two little flicks of metal- you'll need to flatten these with wire cutters or strippers before you assemble the case:

Push the tabs into the case in this pattern, with the little stalk facing up:

Last off, solder together the tabs in a zig zag pattern so that all of the batteries are connected end to end. The button tab is positve, and the spring tab will be negative.
