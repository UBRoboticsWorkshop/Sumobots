# Welcome to Sumobots 2024
We'll be covering different topics in robotics each week, in the following order:

Workshop | Date
--- | --- 
Actuators and Soldering (Free session) | 16/10 
CAD |23/10
Programming|30/10
Catchup|6/11
Communications and Construction |13/11
Final preperation |20/11
Competition|27/11

Each workshop has a folder where you can find the content under README.md, as well as extra "detail" and "extension" files. Detail files provide further reading on the various topics, but you don't need to read it to get your robot working. Extension files provide leads on ways to improve your robot- maybe making your datalink more reliable or allowing finer control of your robot. Again, none of these are needed to make a working robot- but some of these can lead you to major advantages.

We'll also be allowing you to use our lab in the weeks leading up to comp... but only if you have done your hand tool training! Link soon to come:
