# Welcome to Sumobots 2024
We'll be covering different topics in robotics each week, in the following order:

Workshop | Date
--- | --- 
Actuators and Soldering (Free session) | 16/10 
CAD |23/10
Programming|30/10
Catchup|6/11
Communications and Construction |13/11
Final preperation |20/11
Competition|27/11

Each workshop has a folder where you can find the content under README.md, as well as extra "detail" and "extension" files. Detail files provide further reading on the various topics, but you don't need to read it to get your robot working. Extension files provide leads on ways to improve your robot- maybe making your datalink more reliable or allowing finer control of your robot. Again, none of these are needed to make a working robot- but some of these can lead you to major advantages.

We'll also be allowing you to use our lab in the weeks leading up to comp... but only if you have done your hand tool training! Link soon to come:


# Sumobots Rules

## Robots 

•	Robots must weight under 1Kg

•	Batteries are limited to 5AA NiMH cells

•	You can use your own components, but no dangerous parts- if in doubt, ask committee

o	Examples of dangerous parts would include spinners, blades, heated parts

o	The focus of your system should be controlling your opponent’s motion, however some robots may break during matches

## Arena/Goals

•	Robots will fight on an elevated platform

•	Any robot pushed off will lose

•	A robot incapable of motion will be counted out- 10 seconds to display control

•	Matches are limited to 2 minutes

•	If your robot is not operational and you have a match, your match will count as a loss- make sure your robot can survive the fall if you lose!

•	This year, terrain will be added to the arena. Your robot will require enough ground clearance to climb at 10 degrees (this isn’t mandatory, but highly recommended)

## Parts Provided

•	2x small servos 

•	4x geared motors

•	2x motor driver (mx1508 dual H bridge)

•	1x breadboard

•	1x ESP32

•	5x batteries (NiMH AA)

•	10x battery tabs

•	Wires, bolts, acrylic sheeting, wires will be provided as needed

•	Access to makerspace printing- put project under “Robotics” when you book

If you need further information on any of these parts, feel free to ask committee

## Teams

•	Teams will have 2-6 people

•	Late joiners may be assigned to smaller teams
